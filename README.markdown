A ruby library for creating 2D cantor sets.
--------------------------------------------------------

Each fractal (called a Carpet) is determined by a seed and a depth. The seed is a 
2D array that determines which squares are removed, and the depth determines the 
resolution of the image. The resulting image is a PNG.

  require './cantor_carpets'

  seed = Array2D.new(3, 3)

  seed.state = [[1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1]]
  carpet = Carpet.new(seed, 6)
  carpet.write_image('sierpenski.png')

  seed.state = [[1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1]]
  carpet = Carpet.new(seed, 6)
  carpet.write_image('dust.png')

  seed.state = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]
  carpet = Carpet.new(seed, 6)
  carpet.write_image('cross.png')
